# Optimal Portfolio Allocation (Midterm Submission)

This repository contains the coding work completed up to the midterm for the Optimal Portfolio Allocation module.  
The project focuses on analyzing financial assets and portfolios using historical price data and implementing core concepts from portfolio theory using Python.

The work has been carried out incrementally and represents the material and assignments completed up to the midterm stage. Additional components will be added as the course progresses.

## Repository Organization

The repository includes the following notebooks:

- `Week1_Asset_Analysis.ipynb`  
  Analysis of individual assets, including return, volatility, covariance, and correlation.

- `Week2_Portfolio_Analysis.ipynb`  
  Portfolio-level analysis focusing on risk, return, and diversification effects.

- `Week3_Markowitz_Optimization.ipynb`  
  Implementation of the Markowitz mean–variance optimization model and construction of the Efficient Frontier.

Each notebook is self-contained and reflects a completed stage of work up to the midterm.

- Estimation of expected returns
- Measurement of risk using volatility
- Analysis of relationships between assets using covariance and correlation

### Portfolio Analysis
- Construction of portfolios using multiple assets
- Calculation of portfolio return and risk
- Examination of diversification effects across different asset combinations

### Portfolio Optimization
